title: Week 3 - Concept Development and Design
---

We all know the importance of having a good User Interface for any Application. Our goal is to not only provide a good visual to the user but also provide a good user experience. Here are some glimpses of the User Interface Design of our Mobile Application. We have laid down a basic wireframe for the understanding of the developers and create a visual of all necessary components in the application.

## Conclusions

We have carefully analysed the information we got from our week 2 research and made small changes in the project. The problem we were facing in the previous methodology was that, there was no way to find out if the anonymous tip of a first-time submitter is actually true. We conducted some research and after a lot of brainstorming we decided to perform sentiment analysis on the tip description and also run an algorithm on the images they post, to determine if they are genuine and not morphed. The experiments for this would be carried out in the coming week. Our dedicated design team came up with some really exciting wireframes for the interface of our website. This week we were able to document the fonts, colours and layouts that we would be using for the project.
