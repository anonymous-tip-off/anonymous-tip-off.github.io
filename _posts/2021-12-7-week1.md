title: Week 1 - Competitive Analysis
---

Upon conducting extensive research, we were able to come up with a number of anonymous tiplines available all around the world. We have jotted down the pros and cons of each existing solutions :

### 1. p3tips.com
|                ||
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|![p3tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/week1/p3tips.jpg =800x500)|p3tips.com is an anonymous tip-line website for the Crime Stoppers program of Michigan which started in 1976. It promotes social responsibility and provides a secure alternative to silence by anonymous reporting of crime, either by phone or web.<br/><br/> PROS: <br/>• It is web-based and is available on both phone and desktop <br/>• Various fields and collects more data <br/>• Ensures that all fields are filled <br/>• Maintains anonymity<br/><br/>CONS <br/>• Very Cluttered. All fields on same page which makes the user panic. <br/>• Small fields which are frustrating for mobile users <br/>• Since it is a website, it is open for all, however it does not guarantee genuineness of users by any means. <br/>• No means of reward system implementation<br/><br/>|


### 1. slcpd.com

slcpd.com is a Salt Lake City Police Department website. They have a mobile phone number and mail id for users to send in their tip responses. They even have a mobile application called CITYPROTECT for users to text a tip or call anonymously.

PROS:
-	They have a dedicated mobile application for users.
-	Map integration to tag crime.
-	Clear instruction/warning that it is only for tipping and not reporting the crime
-	Allows users to register their camera footage onto the application for surveillance purposes

CONS:
-	The app and website provide only text/SMS, call and mail feature. There are no specific dedicated fields to enter data.
-	User is given opportunity to choose agency which can be tricky because of unawareness of police branches. 
-	Neither the website nor the app guarantees genuineness of users by any means.
-	With call feature, anonymity is compromised as these calls are recorded for documentation and is as good as reporting the crime.

## Conclusions 
We have conducted research on other anonymous tip hotlines available worldwide. We could come up with a few ways that could improve the current system. Taking into consideration the improvements suggested by the mentors in the zeroth phase review, we are trying to implement sentiment analysis on the images and tip description submitted by users to ensure the content is also as genuine as the user. We also intend to use Captcha to eliminate bots. Apart from this, our team has begun the UI Design for the Mobile App that we are building. We hope to complete the same by the next Project Review.
