title: Week 4 - NLP Algorithim Training and Testing

In order to fully understand the backend functionality of the app, it is crucial to know where the information is being sent and what are the end nodes of the system. We have prepared an information flow that helps us map a visual of the architecture of our system.

Methodology as per Information Architecture:

- When the user signs up, using the Aadhaar eKYC process, a unique token is registered based on KYC and an NFT is used for proof of identity. We are thus reducing the user’s identity to a wallet address. In this way, the token can be used to identify and make sure they are genuine users.
- Once the user submits their tip using the Mobile App, this information reaches the law enforcement officers where it undergoes a number of processes.
- As we know we would primarily use Blockchain technology to identify user’s using a Wallet address to ensure anonymity.
- Further our system uses Natural Language Processing to analyze the given tip and auto-categorize crimes based on related keywords
- We would also be using Machine Learning to set rank of an event, based on the crime detected. For this we would be using parameters like location and time of crime, number of tips for same event and category of crimes.
- Finally, once the law enforcement officers conduct investigation to verify the tip, the system tracks the users submitting the tip using the wallet address. Based on if the tip was true or false, the user’s rank goes higher or lower. This ranking helps in utilities like reward points and certification and further reports.

Upon some careful research on sentiment analysis algorithms, we could understand how the algorithm can be implemented onto our platform. The efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of the algorithms depends largely on the characteristics of the datasets, hence the convenience of testing deep learning methods with more datasets in order to cover a greater diversity of characteristics is preferred.

Here are some snapshots of the test run we performed to test the algorithms. Combining sentiment and semantic features, the main objective of our experiments is to compare the performance of these deep learning techniques, contributing to the state-of-the-art literature on sentiment analysis tasks. 

## Conclusions

Our team prepared the information architecture diagram and designed the user flow for both end-users. We did a test run of the Natural Language Processing Algorithm. The algorithm successfully passed all the expected test cases. We also ran unit tests on smart contract to examine token minting, changing ownership and token verification.
