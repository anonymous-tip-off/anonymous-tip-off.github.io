title: Week 2 - Work Strategy and Research
---

Here are some statstics that show hesitation in crime reporting and reasons for not coming forward to report crimes. Throughout the world, most people that don’t report crime are afraid of retaliation. Others don’t report more serious crimes, especially if they are a witness. They don’t want to get involved in going to court and having to testify, putting themselves or their families in a situation where they put themselves at risk, as mentioned above. More women are becoming afraid to report domestic violence in their homes because they have or feel like they have no other options to get out and make it on their own.

As a result of this kind of hesitation, the crime rates continue to go higher and many cases remain unresolved, either because people do not report them or because they do not have sufficient proof to solve the crime. Here are some facts and figures showing how much crime rates have been affected.

## Conclusions

On our second week, we kept in mind the results of the zeroth phase review and decided to include a more recent reference paper. We also did research on crime and reporting, issues faced by the people in reporting crime etc. Further, our team assigned individual roles to each team member and the dedicated roles were a research team, a design team and an analysis team. Our responsibilities included:
- Research Team – Responsible for conducting extensive research about other anonymous tip lines and how blockchain can be used to implement it. We also ensured to look into more recent research papers about crime reporting websites.
- Design Team – The design team would map out all the required components in the website and layout some wireframes which would later be converted into high fidelity mock-ups.
- Analysis Team – To carefully build a strategy to go about the solution to our project and come up with an efficient work plan. The team is also dedicated to pin point any loop-holes in the existing methodology.
